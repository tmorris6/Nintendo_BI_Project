**Nintendo Games Analysis Project**

This project is an independent analysis created for educational and professional purposes. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or licensed by Nintendo or its subsidiaries.

This Project has 3 main parts:

**1. Presentation: Key Findings and Insights** - Nintendo Bi Project.pdf

- A polished Google Slides presentation was created to summarize the analysis.
- It includes:
  - An overview of the dataset and methodology.
  - Highlights of the most significant insights, such as the influence of genres on scores.
  - Visualizations and conclusions presented in an easy-to-understand format.
  - Designed to showcase the results in a professional and compelling way.

**2. Jupyter Notebook: Data Cleaning and Analysis** - Nintendo.ipynb

- The Jupyter Notebook contains the core data cleaning and analysis work.
- Key steps include:
  - Data wrangling and preprocessing to ensure consistency and usability.
  - Grouping and visualizing trends in meta scores, user scores, and genres.
  - Performing genre-based correlation analysis to explore how game genre affects meta scores.
  - Libraries used include pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

**3. Tableau Dashboard: Interactive Data Exploration** - Nintendo BI Project Dashboard.twb (or view the PNG for a brief view)

- A Tableau Dashboard was built to provide an interactive summary of the analysis.
- Features include:
  - Visualizations of meta scores and user scores over time.
  - Heatmaps to show score distributions across genres.
  - Filters for dynamic exploration by genre, year, and other metrics.

**The Presentation is the crux of the analysis and can be viewed as the standalone piece to this project. **


**How to Use this Repository**

The Jupyter Notebook can be previewed in GitHub, and the code can be copied & downloaded.

The Presentation is attached as a PDF and can also be viewed within the Github Repo. Although because there are 13 slides, you need to click the "More Pages" Button at the bottom to view them all

The Dashboard can either be previewed with the attached PNG, or downloaded via the .TWB file

There is also an attached XLSX file that was used for additional analysis included in the Primary Presentation.


**Data Disclaimer**

The dataset used for this project was obtained from publicly available sources. All transformations, analysis, and visualizations are for academic purposes only.


**Project Purpose**

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate and enhance my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling using industry-standard tools and platforms. Through this work, I aimed to:

- Improve my proficiency with Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
- Develop impactful presentations to communicate findings effectively.
- Build interactive dashboards in Tableau to showcase insights and provide dynamic exploration capabilities.
- This project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my ability to apply analytical tools to extract meaningful insights from data.
